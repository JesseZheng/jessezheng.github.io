> **Normal equation**

标准方程能够快速计算(在n相对较小的情况)出θ的值不需要迭代。

| Gradient Descent           | Normal Equation                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Need to choose alpha       | No need to choose alpha                     |
| Needs many iterations      | No need to iterate                          |
| O (kn^2 )             | O (n^3), need to calculate inverse of X^T*X |
| Works well when n is large | Slow if n is very large                     |

In practice, when n exceeds 10,000 it might be a good time to go from a normal solution to an iterative process.

If X^T*X is  <u>noninvertible</u>, the common causes might be having :

- Redundant features, where two features are very closely related (i.e. they are linearly dependent)


- Too many features (e.g. m ≤ n). In this case, delete some features or use "regularization" (to be explained in a later lesson).
